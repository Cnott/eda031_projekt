Large apartment fire downtown!
Anton Friberg
Four people were critically injured in a fire in Chicago's Lakeview
neighborhood overnight. The blaze broke out just before 1:50 a.m. Friday
in the six-unit building in the 3400-block of North Janssen Avenue. When
crews arrived, flames were shooting out of the back of the structure.
Joseph Alfe, who lives next door, was able to get his wife and five
children out of their home safely after he heard noises outside around
2 a.m.
